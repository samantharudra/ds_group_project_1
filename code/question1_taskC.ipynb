    "One of the main challenges faced during the preprocessing phase, was how to handle missing values. By choosing to impute missing values, we introduced potential biases for the sake of not losing information. outlier removal required balancing between improving model accuracy and retaining essential data. Additionally, feature engineering involved assumptions about socioeconomic factors that might not fully capture reality. Overall, the final product effectively models crime rates, but limitations in data availability and potential biases affect its reliability."
